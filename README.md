## Context

This application will digitalise the youth crisis accommodation sector.
Making the process:

* less stressful
* simpler
* easier
* more efficient, reducing costs

### How we are going to do this

A simple responsive web application that allows homeless youths to easily search for available accommodation then to quickly make a booking. Accommodation providers are provided with a simple interface to enter and track their bed vacancies plus a platform to receive accommodation enquiries.
